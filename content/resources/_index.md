#### Historical CVs
I find that it can be intimidating to look at the CVs of people in the
positions you're applying to. However, many times, we forget that we're looking
at someone who is often *several (or more!) years* into this position.
Therefore, I am sharing historical versions of my CV so that you have a
representative perspective of my achievements when I was applying for different
positions from post-undergraduate through to faculty. Furthermore, this should
allow you to see (at least one person's) trajectory. I hope this helps with the
kinds of feelings of under-achievement I had, especially as an early graduate
student who struggled to publish empirical work for many years.

#### Job Application Materials
I was *incredibly fortunate* to only go on the academic job market once and land a TT (tenure track) job at UCRiverside. Below are the application materials that I used in this job search. To streamline the process, I wrote generic versions of the materials and then identified places where I could personalize them for each position (green highlighted text). Therefore, I'm including the template document for each application section as well as how I personalized this for UCR. These materials are meant to be used as a general reference. By posting them publically, I am not granting permission for text to be used exactly or in part in your own application (I would consider this plagarism).
