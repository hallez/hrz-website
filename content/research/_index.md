title: Research
current:
My lab studies how context (e.g., cognitive or mental context, temporal context, spatial context, and many others) influences what we remember and how our memories are represented by the brain. We are also interested in how these processes change across the lifespan into older adulthood. I use behavioral and computational approaches as well as brain imaging tools like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) in my research. I am accepting PhD applicants for the 2023 admissions cycle as well as applications for postdocs on an ongoing basis.
