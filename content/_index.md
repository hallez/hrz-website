I am currently a postdoctoral research scientist in the 
[Aly](https://www.alylab.org/) and [Baldassano](https://www.dpmlab.org/)
labs at [Columbia University](https://psychology.columbia.edu/) where I use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modeling techniques to answer questions about how the brain represents memories.

I completed my PhD in Dr. Charan Ranganath's [Dynamic Memory
Lab](http://dml.ucdavis.edu/) at [UC Davis](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/)
where my work focused on the role of context in memory formation and retrieval.

Prior to being in the DML, I completed my undergraduate training at the
[University of Michigan](http://lsa.umich.edu/psych) (Go Blue!) where I worked
with [Dr. Patricia Reuter-Lorenz](http://parl-lab.psych.lsa.umich.edu/) on the
role of [semantic context in memory
performance](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hrz-website/papers/dimsdale-zucker_reuter-lorenz_2018.pdf).

I then completed a research assistantship with [Dr. Elizabeth
Kensinger](https://www2.bc.edu/elizabeth-kensinger/) at [Boston
College](http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/psych.html) where I expanded this line
of work to investigate how semantic and phonologic contexts differentially
affect [memory performance in college students and healthy
elderly individuals](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hrz-website/posters/CogAging2012_FINAL.pdf).
