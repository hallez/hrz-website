I am currently a graduate student in Dr. Charan Ranganath's [Dynamic Memory
Lab](http://dml.ucdavis.edu/) at [UC Davis](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/)
where my work focuses on the role of context in memory formation and retrieval.

I use high resolution (1.5 mm isotropic voxels) functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) to look at the patterns of activity across voxels in subregions
of the human hippocampus and medial temporal lobes,
[structures intimately implicated in
memory](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/us/05hm.html?_r=0).

Prior to being in the DML, I completed my undergraduate training at the
[University of Michigan](http://lsa.umich.edu/psych) (Go Blue!) where I worked
with [Dr. Patricia Reuter-Lorenz](http://parl-lab.psych.lsa.umich.edu/) on the
role of [semantic context in memory
performance](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/77627/hallez.pdf?sequence=1").

I then completed a research assistantship with [Dr. Elizabeth
Kensinger](https://www2.bc.edu/elizabeth-kensinger/) at [Boston
College](http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/psych.html) where I expanded this line
of work to investigate how semantic and phonologic contexts differentially
affect [memory performance in college students and healthy
elderly](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hrz-website/posters/CogAging2012_FINAL.pdf).
