I am currently an Assistant Professor at [UC Riverside](https://psychology.ucr.edu/). [My lab](https://dzlab.ucr.edu/) studies how context (e.g., cognitive or mental context, temporal context, spatial context, and many others) influences what we remember and how our memories are represented by the brain. We are also interested in how these processes change across the lifespan into older adulthood. I use behavioral and computational approaches as well as brain imaging tools like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) in my research.

I am accepting PhD applicants for the 2023 admissions cycle. If you are interested in joining the lab as a graduate student
please [consult my FAQ page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11DohBPw27yoEphATbT7Ll413yeDjsG7_CdF_KZcxQnQ/edit?usp=drive_link). If you are interested in joining the lab as a postdoc, please [email me directly](mailto:halledz@ucr.edu). For information regarding pay and benefits, please see UCR's [standard benefits information](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/index.html) as well as
general compensation rates for [graduate students](https://supportinggraduatestudents.ucr.edu/compensation-benefits), 
and [postdocs](https://graduate.ucr.edu/postdoctoral-studies#:~:text=Salary%20scales%20(Exempt)%C2%A0effective%2002/01/2021).

I endeavor to prioritize women, Black, and other historically marginalized folks in
my mentoring. Please get in touch if I can provide support (e.g., tips on applying
to grad school, reviewing CVs, etc.). There is also a list of some resources and
readings that I am continually using to educate myself [here](/resources) including
these [Concrete Actions for Academics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic6bil2AvrQmPFUcUyxcw_FumofKkUo3VLsU7qG0cTk/preview?pru=AAABcsK8OBM*vB48ngj1AcbyWPbpAoY87Q#).
I invite criticism and critiques of how I can provide better mentorship and allyship in general,
but, specifically to Black, historically excluded, and underrepresented minoritized scientists.
