I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the
[Aly](https://www.alylab.org/) and [Baldassano](https://www.dpmlab.org/) labs
at [Columbia University](https://psychology.columbia.edu/) where I use
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modeling
techniques to answer questions about how the brain represents memories.
My work is funded by a NRSA F32 fellowship from the National Eye Institute (federal award #: F32EY032352).

I will be joining [UC Riverside](https://psychology.ucr.edu/) as an Assistant Professor, starting Summer 2023.
If you are interested in joining the lab as a lab manager, graduate student, or postdoc,
please email me (halledz<at>ucr.edu) your CV. Official job postings will be linked, once available.
For information regarding pay and benefits, please see UCR's [standard benefits information](https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/compensation-and-benefits/index.html) as well as
general compensation rates for [graduate students](https://supportinggraduatestudents.ucr.edu/compensation-benefits), 
and [postdocs](https://graduate.ucr.edu/postdoctoral-studies#:~:text=Salary%20scales%20(Exempt)%C2%A0effective%2002/01/2021).
Lab manager compensation ranges vary based on experience; please contact me directly for more information.

I endeavor to prioritize women, Black, and other historically marginalized folks in
my mentoring. Please get in touch if I can provide support (e.g., tips on applying
to grad school, reviewing CVs, etc.). There is also a list of some resources and
readings that I am continually using to educate myself [here](/resources) including
these [Concrete Actions for Academics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic6bil2AvrQmPFUcUyxcw_FumofKkUo3VLsU7qG0cTk/preview?pru=AAABcsK8OBM*vB48ngj1AcbyWPbpAoY87Q#).
I invite criticism and critiques of how I can provide better mentorship and allyship in general,
but, specifically to Black, historically excluded, and underrepresented minoritized scientists.
